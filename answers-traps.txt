1.Register a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.
2.There is no call to function f in assembly code for main, compiler inlines fuctions and compute the result that f(8) + 1 = 12, then regard it as an immediate number, the address of the instruction is 26.
3.ra = 0x30, jalr 1536(ra) # 0x630, so address that function printf located is 0x660.
4.0x38, the address of the next instruction of jalr.
5.Output is "HE110 World", Hex of 57616 is "e110", and 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64 is the ASCII of r, l, d, if big-endian, reverse to 0x726c6400, no need to change 57616.
6.x=3 y=1, "y=" the answer is not specific, but in my enviroment y=1.
